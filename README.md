Notes
*****
It appears that google is rolling out some kind of interface update which is shuffling their layout around, right after our
presentation. Unforchunatly since our application requires being appended into a specific div in the interface,
there is no guarentee that our layout will work as featured in our demo. I don't know what the new layout looks like,
but mark said it had changed on his home computer, but not his laptop.
